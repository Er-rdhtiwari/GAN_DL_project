In the above project for that, I used the Anime Face Dataset from the Kaggle and trained two neural networks: a Generator and a Discriminator. The generator generates a "fake" sample given a random vector/matrix, and the discriminator attempts to detect whether a given sample is "real" (picked from the training data) or "fake" (generated by the generator). Training happens in tandem: I trained the discriminator for fifty epochs, then train the generator for fifty epochs, and repeated. This way both the generator and the discriminator get better at doing their jobs. For training I used Leaky ReLU, ReLU activation, Adams optimizer, and Sigmoid function.
